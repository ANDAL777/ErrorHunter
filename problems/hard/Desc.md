## How This Program Works

1. Data Storage: 

-Expenses are stored in a JSON file, making them persistent even when the program is restarted.
Each expense entry includes: amount, category, description, and date.

2.Modularity:

- Functions are divided into clear modules like add_expense, delete_expense, summarize_expenses, etc.

3.Analytics :

- Category-wise Summary: Visualizes the percentage of spending across different categories using a pie chart.
Monthly Summary: Displays monthly totals with a bar graph.

4.CLI Menu:
A simple menu-driven interface for easy interaction.
